# Peaks.js React Example

This is a simple example of how to use [Peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js)
in a React application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Note that this is just a demo and not a feature-complete reusable React component for Peaks.js.

# Getting started

Ensure you have Node.js 14.3.0 or later installed, then:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:chrisn/peaks-react-example.git
$ cd peaks-react-example
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This should open your web browser to view the demo at
http://localhost:3000.
